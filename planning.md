Frontend objectives: <br>
-work on the frontend using React ✅<br>
-create and add a task ✅<br>
-delete a task ✅<br>
-toggle a task aka checking it off <br> 
-make sure that the tasks persist after the page refreshes <br>
-program a 'priortize' button ✅<br>
-program a display where the AI model can generate the prioritized tasks ✅<br>
-program a display showing the list of tasks the user inputs ✅<br>

Backend objectives: <br>
-use a framework like Node/Express or Flask to connect the server to the client <br>
-set up LLM API such as OpenAI API or Claude API <br>
-we will try to program and train the LLM based on 2-3 factors: deadline of the task, difficulty of the task, and duration of the task (optional). <br>
-the AI should retrieve the tasks from the frontend and process them. (CORS) <br>
-the AI should return the priortized tasks to the frontend. (CORS) <br>

Deployment: <br>
-i plan on using Vercel <br>

Should we do a user authentication/login page? <br>
Each user can make an account and store their individual tasks. <br>
We could use a database to store their tasks and return to them. <br>
