Frontend objectives:
-work on the frontend using React
-create and add a task
-delete a task
-make sure that the tasks persist after the page refreshes
-program a 'priortize' button
-program a display where the AI model can generate the prioritized tasks
-program a display showing the list of tasks the user inputs

Backend objectives:
-use a framework like Node/Express or Flask to connect the server to the client
-set up LLM API such as OpenAI API or Claude API
-we will try to program and train the LLM based on 2-3 factors: deadline of the task, difficulty of the task, and duration of the task (optional).
-the AI should retrieve the tasks from the frontend and process them. (CORS)
-the AI should return the priortized tasks to the frontend. (CORS)

Deployment:
-i plan on using Vercel

Should we do a user authentication/login page?
Each user can make an account and store their individual tasks.
We could use a database to store their tasks and return to them.
